                <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl my-1 underline">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
                    post
                    a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company
                    in
                    the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally
                    Identifiable
                    Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
                    exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being
                    shared. See more at:</p>
                <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>

                <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br>
                    Users can visit our site anonymously.
                    Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on
                    the
                    first significant page after entering our website.
                    Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified
                    above.</p>


                <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc px-8 my-2">
                    <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Can change your personal information:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc px-8 my-2">
                    <li>By emailing us</li>
                    <li>By logging in to your account</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl my-1 underline">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

                <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old,
                    the
                    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
                    Commission,
                    United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators
                    of
                    websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

                <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

                <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl my-1 underline">Fair Information Practices</h2>

                <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
                    the
                    concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
                    around
                    the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented
                    is
                    critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

                <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                    should a data breach occur:</p>
                <p>
                    We will notify you via email
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc px-8 my-2">
                    <li>Within 7 business days</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                    legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
                    law.
                    This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but
                    also
                    that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                    non-compliance by data processors.</p>

                <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl my-1 underline">CAN SPAM Act</h2>

                <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
                    commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and
                    spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

                <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc px-8 my-2">
                    <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
                    <li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>
                    <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction
                        has occurred.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc px-8 my-2">
                    <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
                    <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
                    <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
                    <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
                    <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
                    <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc px-8 my-2">
                    <li>Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.
                        and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</li>
                </ul>
